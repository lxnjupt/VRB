# Vivado Runtime Benchmark 

You may also wonder which PC/Server configuration could provide the best performance for Vivado runtime.

The best way is to do the benchmark with same design to see which server configuration could get better results. But it might be not possible to give it a try before purchasing one. So, we may need few pointers before purchasing.
